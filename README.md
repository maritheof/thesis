This repository contains python3 code of the implementation of Ising and Potts model through Swendsed-Wang algorithm. It also contains a neural network
class, which was based on network3.py from the book "Neural Networks and Deep learning" of Michael Nielsen. The neural network class was modified to 
support dropout regularization technique. Finally, the repository contains some methods to produce and shape the data taken from the Ising model 
(src/SW_algorithm.py), so they can be used for the training of the neural network.
